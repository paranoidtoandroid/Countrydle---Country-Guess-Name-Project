This site is made by Metehan YanÄ±t for ACM 365 Term Project.

The project is a guess game inspired by Wordle.

The Code fetches country information API from https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all and displays them on screen while hiding the country name.

If user guesses correctly, they gain 100 points, if they decide to skip they lose 90 points.

Each Revealed information costs 10 points.

The countries are displayed randomly.
